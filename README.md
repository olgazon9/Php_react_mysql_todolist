# PHP, React, and MySQL Todo List

This project is a simple Todo List application using PHP, React, and MySQL. It's designed to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- XAMPP (or any other local server package with PHP and MySQL)
- Node.js and npm
- Git (optional, to clone the repository)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

#### Setting Up the Backend

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Start XAMPP and ensure both Apache and MySQL are running.
3. Create a new database named `project` in phpMyAdmin.
4. Import the SQL schema located at `path/to/sql/schema.sql`.
5. Place the backend PHP code in the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP.

#### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory in the terminal.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Start the React app by running `npm start`. This should launch the app in your default browser.

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are set up, you can:

- Add new tasks.
- View all tasks.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
